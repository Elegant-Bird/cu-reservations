Users have the ability to
1. Get directions to Hendrix Student Center from multiple locations, with an option to use Google Navigation
2. View the Sales and Solicitation form for easy printing and signing
3. View the Reservations Usage Policy
4. Access links to directly contact CU Campus Life Guest Services
5. Email their reservation directly to CU

Please keep in mind that if you need to fill out a room diagram, that will have to be printed from the campus life website for the time being

This application allows you to enter in your organizations name, event name, time of event, and what equipment will be required. Keep in mind that if you fill in the last page of the app with your name and initials, you agree to the CU Campus Life terms and conditions
